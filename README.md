Cars project for Open Frameworks

This is my simulator to teach Steering Behaviors in math&physics classes for games.

To add car behaviors, the student should write AlunoCarro1.h file.
To add more cars to the simulation the file AlunoSetup.h should be modified.

This project is Open Source under GPL 3.0 license.
