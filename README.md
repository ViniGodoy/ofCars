Cars project for Open Frameworks

This is my simulator designed to teach Steering Behaviors in Math&Physics classes for games.

- To add car behavior the student should write AlunoCarro1.h file.
- To add more cars to the simulation the file AlunoSetup.h should be modified.

This project is Open Source under GPL 3.0 license.
